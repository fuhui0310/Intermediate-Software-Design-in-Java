Typically a class modeling the data (here, DataModel.java) handles access of data 
   from multiple CSVModels instead of having a DataModel and a GraphView for each data set.


+1 Well done in investigating using git branches in your workflow.

+0.5 Good description of why you decided to use branches. 

+0 However, for complete extra credit describe of specific discussions you had
