FEEDBACK:

Nice clean implementation of extra credit portion!


Good readable list.
    Consider outputting the column labels *only once* for all countries
    to improve reader-friendliness.


Extra Credit:
+1 implementation of insertAtIndex() method.
+1 clearly defined test cases for insertAtIndex() method.   
+2 successfully tested insertAtIndex() method.   

-Bita.
